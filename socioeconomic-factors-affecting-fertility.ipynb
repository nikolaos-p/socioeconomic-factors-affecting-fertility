    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to identify some of the socioeconomic variables that may be connected to the fertility rate of each country. The dataset is provided by the World Bank and is hosted in BigQuery. More information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/world-bank-health-population).\n",
    "\n",
    "Health statistics for different countries and years are included in the dataset, and the total fertility rate is the main variable of interest in this analysis. This rate generally tracks the number of children an average woman will have during her reproductive years. A more detailed definition is provided by the United Nations as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The average number of live births a hypothetical cohort of women would have at the end of their reproductive period if they were subject during their whole lives to the fertility rates of a given period and if they were not subject to mortality. It is expressed as live births per woman.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the United Nations, a level of  2.1 children per woman is required in most countries to maintain a stable population. This is also called \"replacement level fertility\" and may be higher for countries with high infant mortality rates."

It should be noted that sufficient data were not available during this period. Over the years a lot of countries have joined this cluster of about 100% enrollment and 1-2 children. A negative relationship between fertility and secondary education, as well as gross national income per capita, is visible during the whole period.
